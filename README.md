# HolmespunTestingSupport

This repository provides testing support using two main programs:

1. Kamaji Automated Test Manager.

	The Kamaji program is designed for users who believe in the use of automated testing, test-driven development,
	and the demonstrative output paradigm.

2. Command-Line Utility Test (CLUT) Framework.

	The CLUT framework allows users to test command-line programs using a series of test cases that are executed
	in an isolated directory with user-defined inputs and command-line parameters.
	The CLUT framework is fully integrated into the Kamaji program.
