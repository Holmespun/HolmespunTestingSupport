    |
    |Where <modifier> is one of the following:
    |      fast
    |      help
    |      silent
    |      verbose
    |
    |Where <request> is one of the following:

    |      export [ ruleset ]
    |      grade  [ <filename> | last ]...

    |      review [ <filename> | last ]...
    |      set    <name> <value>
    |      show   [ configuration | copyright | version ]
    |
    |Synonyms configure (set), noisy (verbose), quiet (silent), and usage (help) are
    |supported. Modifier and request abbreviations are also supported; ambiguity is
    |resolved using alphabetical order. No other modifiers or requests are applied
    |after a usage request is fulfilled.
    |
    |Further help may be displayed by following the usage request by the subject of
    |interest; for example, "kamaji help fast" or "kamaji usage grade"
    |
    |CLUT cases and unit test exercises are used and evaluated in similar ways:
    |compile it (if not already executable), invoke it to produce output, mask that
    |output, compare the masked output to its baseline, and then grade it based on
    |that comparison.
    |
    |CLUT definitions are compiled into Bash scripts. Unit test exercises may be
    |written in compilable code or a scripting language. Compilable code must be
    |compiled and linked into executable files using a make framework. Scripts need
    |not be compiled.
    |
    |CLUT cases and unit test exercises produce demonstrative output that need not
    |be valid or invalid on its face. Users must evaluate the initial output from
    |these tests to determine whether it is valid; valid output must be blessed by
    |the user and copied to a safe location as baseline output. Future changes to
    |the tested code will result in output that differs from the baseline; these
    |differences should also be blessed to update the baseline. Users will benefit
    |from retesting frequently between minor and controlled functional changes to
    |the code being tested.
    |
    |Passing grades are only granted when current output matches baseline output,
    |but this matching is only attempted after the current and baseline output are
    |masked. Masking is performed using a user-defined sed script.
